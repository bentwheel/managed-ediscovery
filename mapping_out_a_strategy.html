                               <h6>BY DOMINICK JAAR | AMERICAN BAR</h6>
                               <hr >
                              <P>With the advent of electronic discovery, different organizations have explored the possibility to insource or outsource it. However, in order to make such an important decision, they must assess a number of factors that this paper will look at. We will look at the different parts of the EDRM (EDRM.net) that can be insourced or outsourced.</p>
                               <p>The initial question that any organization should answer is "why"? What are the motivations behind the decision to assess how they currently handle electronic discovery and what is it they are trying to achieve.</p>

<h4>Motivations</h4>
<p>The motivations to insource or outsource electronic discovery will normally differ based on variables such as:

The type of organization;
Its information management maturity;
Its human resources savvyness and availability;
Its IT infrastructure;
Its litigation and investigation profile.
However, the motivations themselves are often quite similar: costs, burden and risks. We will look at each of them and provide examples of how the abovementioned variables impact on the motivations</p>

<h4>Costs</h4>
<p>The leading motivation for all organization is costs. Often this motivation finds its roots in a costly experience where a lot of money was spent on handling electronic discovery via a third party. However, after the shock, it is important to look back at the incident and objectively look at cause(s) behind the expenses that were incurred. What one normally realizes is that given the source(s), merely insourcing e-discovery wouldn't reduce the costs of the next occurrence.</p>

<p>Another version of the monetary motivation is for law firms and lawyers to think that they can make money out of e-discovery. This impression created a trend starting around 2005 during which many—major law firms—decided to acquire sophisticated software to collect, process and review electronic documents. However, by now, most of them have realized that technology is a minimal part of the equation: it also requires a methodology, a business model, a scalable team of skilled professionals that will stay current about new issues and technology, hardware, an organizational culture, etc. Therefore, a large number reassessed their strategy and decided to re-outsource, at least partially, electronic discovery.</p>

<p>For those organizations—aw firms and corporations—that are looking at whether or not to insource e-discovery, the clear answer that should come out of the assessment is how much money will be saved or made by insourcing which phase of the EDRM (EDRM.net) and perhaps, most importantly, at what cost? In the end, many organizations—with the exception of organizations that are in the business of being sued—realize that cost rarely is the most compelling reason to insource e-discovery.</p>

<h4>Burden</h4>
<p>While we are convinced that eventually e-discovery will ease discovery and streamline litigation and investigation, for the moment, it is a truism to state that it is burdensome to most organization. Accordingly, corporations and law firms alike have dreamt that by acquiring expensive software and hardware, they would be capable of reducing their burden, to realize that it only created a new one—while increasing risks and costs.</p>

<p>In fact, e-discovery being a process, not a technology™, the only proven way to reduce the burden of e-discovery on any organization is to have clearly predefined processes with policies, procedures, responsibilities and resources. The one positive aspect of acquiring technology is that it forces the organization to train a number of resources who, in turn, will be capable of documenting and improving processes to effectively reduce the burden.</p>

<h4>Risks</h4>
<p>Delays or loss of control over confidential information are just two of the numerous risks that exist when an organization decides to outsource e-discovery. Conversely, these risks are often the motives behind an organization's decision to insource. Under such circumstances, the burden and cost do not weight much in the balance as the priority is to reduce, if not totally mitigate, these risks.Insourcing or Outsroucing E-Discovery?</p>

<h4>Capacity</h4>
<p>At this time, many organizations do not have the inherent capacity to handle e-discovery internally. This situation can be explained by the fact that we are still in a transitional phase from the paper to the electronic world and that the information management maturity of organizations is nascent. Accordingly, in order to insource any phase of the EDRM, an organization needs to have the capacity to do so from a human and technology perspective.</p>

<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>Technology-wise there is a lot to know. First of all, the e-discovery software market is still fairly green. Every year sees its load of new e-discovery technology, each targeting a different part of the EDRM. This creates a number of challenges for organizations who may end up needing too many technologies and will likely find themselves, in the near future, with outdated and unsupported solutions.</p>

<h4>Stay current</h4>
<p>In choosing to insource e-discovery, it is primordial to retain technology, and therefore providers, who will be around in one, three and five years, and will keep on investing in the development of their product. A number of companies are created just for the purpose to be acquired by a major player and many of the latter purchase their competitors just to take them out of the market without any interest to support their technology.</p>

<p>Another reality of the e-discovery market is that one rarely ends up owning the technology. Most companies license their technology on a per gigabyte basis so that, month after month, or quarter after quarter, the "owner" is forced to pay for the use of its technology…</p>

<h4>Scalability</h4>
<p>An important challenge of e-discovery is that each case and each technology are not created equal. While a piece of software may be perfect for small and medium cases, it may not be suitable for larger cases, and vice versa. Therefore, in assessing the technology before its acquisition, one must look at its liti/investigation profile.</p>

<h4>Human</h4>
<p>The human factor is probably the one that is being overlooked the most when decision is made to insource e-discovery. We have seen many organizations invest millions of dollars in technology to realize that they did not have the man power to support, maintain and use it, or the volume of work to justify the head count. Once again, one of the challenges of e-discovery is that it exists at the limit between the legal and technical expertise. Accordingly, depending on the case, it requires different skills and experiences that are rarely to be found in one person.</p>

<h4>Stay current</h4>
<p>Given the constant evolution of the law, the case law and the technology, software and hardware alike, it is necessary to ensure that any employee involved in the e-discovery process is knowledgeable about the potential issues that exist and is capable of cost-efficiently deal with them.</p>

<h4>Scalability</h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, some cases require a large number of experts or simply an important number of tactical delivery people. Unfortunately, most organizations cannot afford to have all these people on staff at all time, just in case. Therefore, some part of the EDRM should systematically be outsourced, at least in part, to take into consideration the need for scalability. This can be achieved by having a preferred relationship with a vendor that will know and understand your internal process and jump on board when the need arises.</p>

<h4>What can you afford to in/outsource?</h4>
<p>Having the EDRM in mind, the next question normally relates to what an organization should or can insource. Depending on the abovementioned variables, different parts of the EDRM may or should be internalized by an organization.</p>

<h4>Information Management</h4>
<p>In fact, electronic discovery is after the fact information management ("IM"), i.e. that we try to find, retrieve and organized unorganized information for the purpose of a liti/investigation. This part of the EDRM must be insourced by all organizations. IM is a cost of doing business. In the paper world, no one would have invested in a company where higher management would refuse to provide their employees with folders, filing cabinets, etc. and that tolerated that its employees keep unsorted files under their desks, in their car or at home. Interestingly enough, this is exactly what is happening in the electronic world…</p>

<h4>Identification</h4>
<p>This part of the EDRM relies heavily on the previous part. Once the information is managed, it should be easier to identify which information is or is not relevant. However, it is unlikely that all the material will ever be perfectly tagged and organized. Accordingly, it is necessary for organizations to have a robust enough search capacity to find relevant information across its network. As one can imagine, this need exists from a productivity and efficiency standpoint. We should not wait for e-discovery to justify such an acquisition.</p>

<h4>Preservation</h4>
<p>Preservation is an important challenge given the volatility of electronic documents. Therefore, until all companies convert their documents to a static format, such as PDF/A, on a WORM (Write Once Read Many) medium, it will be necessary to find means to ensure that relevant documents are not altered once a preservation obligation arises. What is seen in most organization is a preservation-collection effort, where data will be copied and set aside, similar to what we did in the paper world. As in the paper world, this part of the EDRM should be internalized as it merely requires the electronic version of a photocopier. In fact, software is often a lot smaller than the latter and in some cases, as easy to use, a getting user-friendlier by the day.</p>

<h4>Collection</h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, we feel this part of the EDRM must be internalized by organization if they want to keep control over their information ecosystem. Depending on third parties to extract our own information seems awkward. That being said, it is obvious that an organization will not, and should not, be capable of collecting all of its data forever. It should focus on active files as opposed to, for example, archived, deleted or legacy files.</p>

<h4>Processing</h4>
<p>This is the area where we doubt the most about the realisticness of full internalization. Given the subtlety and the number of technology that exists in the processing phase—denisting, indexing, coding, sorting, filtering, concept, context and pattern searching, clustering, deduping, etc.—it is impossible for an organization to internalize processing. What makes sense however is to identify the 20% of technology that will support 80% of the cases and rely on third parties for the remainder; there may even be a proportionality call made for these remaining cases…</p>

<h4>Review</h4>
<p>Unless you are a law firm or your corporation is in the business of being sued, it is not practical to insource review from a technological standpoint. Even in such a case, it may not be the best solution. Most review platforms have been developed for one particular case and are therefore excellent for similar matters but may not be suitable for other types of cases. For instance, some of these technologies are excellent with emails while others support databases like a charm. In such different scenarios, which platform should your organization choose? An alternative to client solutions, it may be sensible to leverage SAAS for document review as new affordable platforms appear every day.</p>

<h4>Analysis and Production</h4>
<p>Evidence analysis has historically been left to lawyers and many good and relatively cheap litigation support software exist to support this phase. There is no doubt that any litigator should have the tools required to perform his work in the 21st century…</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Questions relating to the pros and cons of internalizing vs. outsourcing e-discovery are just starting to be identified as more organizations look seriously at it. Until the market matures, i.e. likely over the next 5 years, it is uncertain that any of the answers provided will stand. The reality of the current market is such that what was thought as being impossible, disproportionate or unreasonable only 3 years ago is now done on a daily basis. Accordingly, in assessing your organizations needs, you should make choices that are scalable and have a good life expectancy.</p>
