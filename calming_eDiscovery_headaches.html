                               <h3>How e-discovery managed services can streamline litigation processes and costs.</h3>
                               <h6>BY MONICA BAY | LEGALTECH NEWS</h6>
                               <hr >
                              <p>It's no secret that law firms—of all sizes—face increasing pressure from clients to provide better, faster, cheaper and transparent legal services. The days are gone when a lawyer could send a bill "for services rendered" and expect payment with no questions asked.</p>
<p>Add to that the explosion of information generated by new technologies. We now live in the era of Big Data—information created via smartphones, email, social media and the Internet of Things (devices that send data to the Internet with no human intervention)—and all that data may be relevant in litigation. Figuring out how to manage electronic data discovery, with the best combination of people, processes and technology, can be taxing for even the smartest law firm leaders.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, e-discovery has matured, as have options available to law firms, corporate law departments and government agencies. Organizations have explored everything from creating internal teams to handle all aspects of e-discovery, to outsourcing overseas or in-sourcing (creating e-discovery outposts in the U.S., but in less expensive regions). But a hybrid option is gaining traction, especially with the Am Law 200: e-discovery managed services (EMS).
<p>What is EMS? Think infrastructure-as-a-service. While vendors' offerings vary, the basic concept is that organizations don't have to bear the responsibility of selecting, acquiring and maintaining e-discovery technology—the vendors provide hardware and software, and also can assign trained professionals to help the organization address e-discovery.
<p>Key advantages: Minimal capital expenditures for the purchaser and no need to ramp up IT and processing personnel for one case—and then reduce staff when big troops aren't necessary.
Am Law 200 firms have been steadily embracing this concept. The Cowen Group's 2012 "E-discovery Models and Structures Survey" found that 10 percent of law firm respondents were engaged in a managed services agreement. By 2014's "E-discovery Technology Investment Trends Survey," the number doubled.
In a 2015 white paper, Stephanie Maw, director of Keating Muething & Klekamp's e-discovery and litigation support group, said the latest buzzword is "right sourcing"—where firms mix internal and external resources to accomplish a task. "At its core, right sourcing is simply ensuring the most suitable person or group available is performing a particular scope of work for which they are most qualified in comparison to other alternatives, with the highest expertise available in comparison to other alternatives, and, importantly, in the most cost-conscious manner available as compared to other reasonable alternatives," she wrote.
<p>...</p>
<h4>COST MANAGEMENT: WIN-WIN</h4>
<p>The common denominator in discussions with industry leaders was money—interviewees cited financial accountability as a top reason to move to EMS. Even in a modest case, e-discovery costs can soar to the point of exceeding the value of a case, as many jurists have noted, including federal Judge Shira Scheindlin and retired federal Magistrate Judge John Facciola. "The costs of litigation are completely out of control," wrote Facciola in Law Technology News. "I did not become a judge to be a monitor in the playground were only the rich can play."</p>
<p>EMS helps firms and clients understand and harness e-discovery costs, and make expenses more predictable, proponents argue. That can go a long way to keep corporate/government clients (and law firm capital expenditure professionals) happy. The transparency helps firm leaders determine if they want to bill e-discovery costs or write them off as a non-billable cost-of-doing-business expense. When they do bill, it is almost always a delicate task.</p>
<p>"In the past, when e-discovery was less of a focus in litigation, firms would carry their own infrastructures for hosting (and sometimes processing) electronically stored information, and clients saw the associated costs as 'overhead' accounted for somewhere in the legal fees paid," said Dykema partner Dante Stella. As data volumes expanded radically, it became challenging: "ESI became the predominant source of discovery material; the processing/hosting market moved predominantly to volume-based models; and the industry commoditized around platforms using those models," he said
"Firms now are faced with a tough choice," said Stella. The options: either expand an infrastructure with significant hardware and storage—with "support costs they could likely never recover (in part due to strong downward market pressure on rates in general)"—or "move to now-conventional third-party processing and hosting (outsourced) arrangements."</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty, he said, is the "paradox of client perception: where a service was provided by a law firm, it was considered 'overhead' by clients; where exactly the same services were provided by a third party, clients were more willing to pay for them."</p>
<p>Dykema's CIO David Hambourger saw the opportunity with EMS "to change our business model to make it more equitable for clients of the firm that don't use these services." With services outside the firm's walls, it was easier to make that happen, he said. "There was certainly an economic strategy involved in it too."</p>
<p>Womble partner David Mazza acknowledged that some firms see processing and hosting as billable tasks, but in most cases, "we provide the database pretty much as a service." That policy, he said, "is attractive to our clients." His firm views document review as a revenue source; Womble has a very busy in-house team. It's "a business we are looking to expand and grow and make money for the firm," he observed.
Mazza compares charging for database processing to being billed for shop tools and towels when his car is repaired. "If I had shop tools and towels, I'd do it myself on my driveway, right? I shouldn't have to pay a 10-15 percent service charge," he said. "A litigation database is the equivalent of a shop tool for a law firm." I think our clients expect tools—without a service charge, he said.</p>
<h4>PREDICTABILITY & STANDARDIZATION</h4>
<p>Jones Walker's CIO Ruark Chick also puts money front and center. As CIO, one of the hats you have to wear is financial, he said.</p>
<p>In 2012, the firm decided to revaluate its technology after receiving a 300 percent annual price increase for crucial software, recalled R.P. Smith, manager of practice support. As the firm considered a move to EMS, a key issue became clear, said Chick. They needed a system that was standardized, so attorneys, clients, and co-counsel could be trained and move fluidly from one case to another. It had to be simple, scalable and flexible—a system that could handle both small and huge cases. A hosted vendor can provide "an economy of scale that you can't match internally," he said.</p>
<p>When the firm can give an estimate of costs for a project, that's very helpful to corporate counsel, Chick said. Even then, the clients may worry about variants. "Who wants to sign a blank check? No one does. Would you do that if you bought a house?" he posed. "We don't want to be our clients' money pit. We want to be a source that they can rely on, trustworthy."</p>
<p>Seyfarth also faced a dilemma, recalled partner Scott Carlson: Should it staff a 24/7 litigation support group? They needed to cover "extensive weekends and overnight stints—that was one of the triggers for the firm’s decision to explore EMS," he said. They chose a hybrid system. "We have to be responsive to all sorts of clients," explained Carlson. Some clients want to use existing vendors and equipment, others have preferred providers, some say, "I don't really know, you guys are the experts, you pick," he said.</p>
<p>The decision helped Seyfarth "gain capacity, and to take that capacity and charge back to our clients via a bundled rate," Carlson said. "That generally eliminated 'menu pricing' charging per tiff or per load file generation, etc. "</p>
<p>"Going forward, we want to achieve certainty for the clients and for us," he said. "We want to deliver services, at a lower price than perhaps they would get on the marketplace—and offer our lawyers the same approach over and over. We expect to gain efficiencies." Trial teams will be able to better use "the capabilities, enhanced analytics and all sorts of other things—because we'll see the same vendor all the time and benefit from the savings," said Carlson.</p>  
<h4>UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES</h4>
<p>Lori Chavez, director of Seyfarth's litigation information management office, wanted a "true partner ... who would function as part of our team," to help with e-discovery. "We see this as an offshoot of our internal litigation support team," she said of the profitable unit.</p>
<p>An unexpected consequence bloomed—Chavez quickly realized that some of her expectations proved wrong, in a good way. For example, employees sometimes worry that they might lose their jobs when a firm engages an EMS. That sometimes happens, she acknowledged, but more often, employees leapfrog to a better assignment. That's what happened when Seyfarth triggered its EMS. One staffer expected to continue an assignment, but it quickly became clear that the EMS team could handle the task faster. She wasn't the only one to elevate to more challenging assignments.</p>
<p>Another surprise: EMS helped Seyfarth keep strong employees. Before EMS, the firm "lost quite a few good people," said Chavez. "People who want to talk to attorneys and manage projects don't want to load data and do technical tasks." With EMS, people were "back up to that higher level ... that's consultative and adds value." Before, even though lawyers and clients appreciated the technical work, "I don't think they gave the department the same level of confidence that we have now," she said.</p>
<p>Dykema's Ellen Kain, director of litigation support, also benefited from EMS. She joined the firm as an analyst and served as a "hot seat" technician at trials. The firm brought processing data in-house, as a profit center. So Kain took a certification course for kCura's Relativity and became a "Relativity Certified Administrator." That ultimately lead to her current role, with a salary jump; and she sees more growth ahead.</p>
<h4>WIN-WIN, TAKE TWO</h4>
<p>At Seyfarth, EMS also provided a new way to address a difficult problem. Realization had dropped, because clients and attorneys alike were facing economic pressures and didn't want technology to be billed, said Chavez. "So we used this as an opportunity to change the way we bill for services," she said. "Now our project manager's time is included in the service fee that we charge for discovery."
<p>Another win-win: The unit no longer bills on an hourly basis, but on the amount of data received by clients. "So we are actually billing our clients less, so that's great for our clients. But we are recovering more."</p>
<p>Ultimately, perhaps the new buzzword hits the spot: e-discovery managed services may indeed be "right-sourcing" for both law firms and their clients.</p>
